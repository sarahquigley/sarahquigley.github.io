## What is this project?

This is a tiny website with a little information about me, and a comprehensive set of links relating to me and my projects.

## How did you make this?

Nothing fancy going on here, just some simple css and media queries. 

## Why did you make this?

I realised I didn't have anywhere describing all the diverse things that I've done, and places that you can find me. This is the beginning of that. I expect it to improve and evolve significantly over time.
